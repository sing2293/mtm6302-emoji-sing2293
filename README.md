## Report Section

### I began by collecting Unicode values for various animal-related emojis. Using a grid-based layout in HTML and CSS, I structured emoji cards to ensure a visually appealing and organized presentation. JavaScript was used to dynamically render the emojis alongside their respective code points, ensuring that each element was correctly aligned.

###  The project was a valuable experience in structuring Unicode-based content and working with responsive grid layouts.
